# React + Vite Todo List App

This project is a simple Todo List Application built with React using Vite as the build tool. It serves as a great example of how to get started with React projects for beginners.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This Todo List app allows users to:

Add tasks

Read or view the task list

Edit tasks

Delete tasks

All of these features are implemented using React hooks and component-based architecture, making the code clean, modular, and easy to understand.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
React (with functional components)

Vite (for fast build and development)

React Hooks (useState)

SweetAlert2 (for nice modals)

ðŸ§  Key Concepts
Component-based development: Each logical section of the app is divided into reusable components.

React Hooks: We use useState for managing form inputs and the list of todos.

CRUD Operations:

Create a task using an input field

Read the full list of tasks displayed on the screen

Update/Edit an existing task using a modal input

Delete a task with confirmation
